Passage's platform empowers immigrants and international students by matching their talents with the most crucial workforce needs in their destination countries. We then work to provide financial solutions and connect them to the logistical support they need, facilitating their transformational journeys to study or work abroad.\n\nThe team that we have assembled thus far is very impressive (including IOI medalists, previous co-founders and C suites of successful startups.) Since we want to build a very lean team, we are looking for super talented and mission driven Senior Software Engineers to join our team. We code in Python, Django, TypeScript, React, and React Native, and are open to adopting new technologies when needed.\n\nWe are currently in search of full-stack engineers, and we recognize that software engineers often have their strengths either in frontend or backend development. If your expertise leans towards frontend development, we highly value your eye for design and the ability to craft engaging user experiences. On the other hand, if your expertise is primarily in backend development, we expect your proficiency in architecting complex services and databases. In both cases, we place a strong emphasis on your ability to contribute to informed product decisions.\n\nIt's important to note that we maintain an in-office working policy, and we require candidates to either reside in Toronto or be open to relocating to the area and committing to a five-day-a-week in-office schedule.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nDesign, develop, and maintain complex software applications\nLead the technical design and architecture of software systems\nCollaborate with cross-functional teams to develop new features and products\nWrite clean, maintainable code in accordance with best practices\nParticipate in code reviews and provide feedback to improve overall code quality\n\nRequirements\n\n5+ years of experience as a software engineer\nProficient in Python, Django, TypeScript, React, and React Native\nDeep knowledge of software design patterns and architecture\nStrong understanding of database design and development\nExcellent communication and problem-solving skills\nExperience with cloud platforms such as AWS is a plus"
