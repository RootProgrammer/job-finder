  "job_description": "Introduction to Caddie\n\nCaddie AI is building the future of sales by completely changing what \u201cemail\u201d looks like. Gmail is great for personal use, but it comedically terrible for sales. We\u2019re building the new operating system for sales, powered by AI \u26a1. We are a Y Combinator company and have recently raised $3M+ from top tier investors.\n\nWe're building our core product in stealth so you won't find anything online about it. We'd love to share the sneak peak over our first call.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nBuilding something incredible, from scratch. That\u2019s right, you would be one of only two engineers on our team helping us build the future of sales with AI. We\u2019re building a new product from the ground up and we need your help. From pixels to deployment to AI models and everything in between. We need you to craft the experiences of the future and bring AI into them. You\u2019ll get to work closely with the founders of Caddie to not only set a technical direction but also influence the trajectory of the company.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Looking For\n\nWe\u2019ll keep it short. We\u2019re looking for great people rather than checking 100 boxes.\n\n4+ years of experience building modern web applications\nDegree in Computer Science or related discipline\nFull-stack experience that includes React, Typescript, RESTful APIs, Postgres, AWS/ECS\nGreat bonus if you have experience with NextJS, NestJS, Pulumi, Terraform, Domain driven design, LLama 2, GPT-4, AWS Sagemaker, Micro services.\nA passion for building something incredible from the ground up\nA startup mindset (collaborate, move quickly, iterate)\nYou live in (or near) Toronto or Vancouver, Canada.\n\nAn \u201cExtreme\u201d Vacation Policy \ud83d\ude0e\n\nWe believe that taking time off is essential for mental health and enjoying life beyond work. It also turns out it\u2019s great for productivity. That\u2019s why we close the company for 6 weeks a year \ud83e\udd2f. In addition, you have 2 more weeks you can take whenever you like. Come do the best work of your life, and get time back for everything else that matters.\n\nHighlights\n\n\u26a1 2nd Software Engineer on the team\n\n\ud83d\udcab Work on exciting AI products\n\n\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f 8 weeks vacation\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Significant equity ownership\n\n\ud83d\udd4b Build a product from scratch\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Join the ground floor of a rocketship"
