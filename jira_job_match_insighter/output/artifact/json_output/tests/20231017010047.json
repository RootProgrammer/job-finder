  "job_description": "Join our small, fiery team on our mission to usher in the Bitcoin golden age.\n\nShakepay is one of the fastest growing startups in Canada. We've grown 10x in the last year. 2% of Canadians are on Shakepay. We're building something really special. We need true believers to join our team. We're looking for ambitious professionals with a thirst for knowledge that are interested in working with the most exciting financial innovation ever created: Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is important because it enables wealth to be stored with a person without need for a third party. Its fundamental use-case as a store of value with a predictable monetary policy is having profound implications on freeing people into financial sovereignty.\n\nSenior Full Stack Developer\n\nImagine shaking your phone to instantly earn bitcoin. Our customers might think it\u2019s magic, but if you\u2019re reading this you probably know that it\u2019s not (or is it?). It\u2019s not. It\u2019s our stellar dev team that makes it happen. That shaking idea started as a secret easter-egg for our fledgling customer base, and once word got out about it, we suddenly had to deal with service outages from too many people shaking at the same time.\n\nOf course we\u2019ve since solved that problem, and now with over 1,000,000 shakers (aka \u201ccustomers''), it\u2019s a core part of our identity\u2014not the shaking, but the idea that we came up with something new and exciting in the slow and boring world of financial services. We\u2019re looking for a staff developer to help us reimagine how Canadians build wealth and think about what they can do with their money. Unique ideas and the knowledge and determination to make them a reality: that\u2019s the real magic.\n\nTotally real Shakepay reviews from the future, after you join:\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Does Shakepay run on literal magic?\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 I thought magic wasn\u2019t real.

In fact, Shakepay is the easiest way for Canadians to buy and earn bitcoin. We\u2019ve got a one of a kind community of shakers (aka \u201ccustomers\u201d) that keeps on growing, regardless of how the crypto market is doing. They love Shakepay almost as much as they love bitcoin, which is really saying something.
