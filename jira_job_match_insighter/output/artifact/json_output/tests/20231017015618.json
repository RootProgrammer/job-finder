Think of it like Loom, but for in-product walkthroughs.\n\nWe're reimagining learning and development for the way knowledge work is done today and building a future where everyone has the guidance they need to realize their full potential at work\u2014from their first week and beyond.\n\nWe're looking for a full-stack Senior Software Engineer (Django/React) to join our small, but mighty founding team, and to take our product to the next level. This is a 100% remote role and our team is fully distributed. Driveway has no location or time zone preferences.\n\nWhat you'll do\nDesign, build, and operate the systems and services that power Driveway's world-class product experience.\nTake new features from concept to shipped product.\nCome up with new product directions and contribute ideas.\nInterview and recruit more talented engineers to join Driveway as we scale.\nImprove our engineering standards, tooling, and processes.\nEnsure our systems and processes are following security and compliance best practices.\nWhat you bring\nYou have 4+ years of development experience\u2014designing and building high-volume, scalable SaaS applications from end-to-end.\nYou have expertise in Python/Django and/or TypeScript/React development.\nYou're driven by impact. You are excited to work on hard problems when they have a big impact on customer experience.\nYou care deeply about the quality of the software and systems you build, but understand the balance between idealism and pragmatism. You have a desire to work in an environment which values speed of iteration and individual autonomy.\nYou're a problem solver. You can think in systems and work from first principles to design a solution and take action. You have a strong desire and ability to work through ambiguity.\nYou have excellent technical communication skills. You believe clear, accessible documentation is just as important as any in-app feature. You enjoy writing and sharing your knowledge with others. Working in the open is your default.\nYou value inclusivity, collaboration, and the freedom to tackle ambitious goals while having fun."
