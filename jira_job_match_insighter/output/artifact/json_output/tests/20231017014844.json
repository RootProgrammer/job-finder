  "job_description": "Senior Mobile Developer - Flutter/Dart\n\nAbout Peggy\n\nPeggy is the secure marketplace for investment-grade art. The company was founded by serial entrepreneurs Craig Follett and Adam Meghji, who have worked together for over a decade, and sold their last business to Live Nation Entertainment.\n\nIn times of societal crisis and turmoil throughout humanity, artists pave the way for social change and transformation. As an investment, art is among the only appreciating asset classes you can also enjoy (like real estate), plus is uncorrelated to traditional markets. This is why billionaires and banks seek out art as a safe haven to preserve wealth in their portfolios. Yet tragically, the rest of us are unable to participate in the art market, and support the practice of emerging artists who create transformative messages through their works.\n\nPeggy partners with galleries and artists, to make living with and investing in art accessible to all. Finally you can buy incredible art at a price you can afford, and can later sell to fellow collectors if your tastes change or you seek to rebalance your art investments. Core to our values, Peggy does good by the artists themselves, who can finally earn artist royalties for all future secondary sales as well - something they miss out on today. This is all made possible using sophisticated and proprietary AI and ML which keeps buyers and sellers protected without the need for the antiquated and opaque Auction House model.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nPeggy is looking for a talented Flutter developer to work on our mobile-first frontend app. You will be partnering with our design, backend, and technical leadership teams as we drive towards our exciting alpha release.\n\nOur world-class design team extensively uses Figma to create hi-fi mobile interfaces. You are responsible for providing initial developer feedback to them directly and iterating in Figma, before building the interfaces in Flutter. The backend team will provide you with an elegant and well-documented GraphQL API as an entry-point into Peggy's content, data, and business logic, and can incorporate your feedback as the API's first consumer.\n\nPeggy's CTO, who will be involved in reviewing, testing, and providing feedback on your work.
