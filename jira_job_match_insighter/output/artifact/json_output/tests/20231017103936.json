  "job_description": "About Shopify\n\nShopify is innovating faster than any other commerce stack. We put independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We transform enteprises and work with some of the world's biggest names and brands who are pushing the limits \u2014 and expect us to, too.\n\nWhile millions of merchants in over 175 countries already use Shopify, the remaining opportunity is vat. This is life-defining work that directly impacts people\u2019s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nWe are not here to play a zero-sum game. Our software engineering team is driven by a greater purpose - to enable entrepreneurship and create new value for the world. We believe in unlimited personal growth for the individuals who build our product. At our core, we are a team that gets shit done, ships fast, and embraces a culture of continuous learning.\n\nIn our work, we operate with low process and high trust. We trade on impact, not on corporate structures or in-person office environments. If you're looking for a prescriptive and rigid work environment, this might not be the right place for you. But if you thrive on change, can solve complex problems, and can handle a bit of chaos, then welcome aboard.\n\nHere, we value independent thinkers who seek growth. We care deeply about what we do and commit to continuously developing our craft. We understand that to make commerce better for everyone, we need to serve and support those who may have different beliefs than us. This means seeing the bigger picture and leaving personal beliefs outside the room.\n\nJoining our team means working with the most driven crafters who pursue mastery. Growth is not just an opportunity here, it's an expectation. We provide resources to help you push yourself out of your comfort zone because we believe in thriving, not just surviving, on change and chaos. We are building products for the long-term, aiming to make a lasting impact as a 100-year company. Navigating ambiguity and embracing change is what sets us apart.\n\nIf you're ready to be part of a team that challenges the status quo and pushes boundaries, then we want you. We are currently looking for a Senior Staff Engineer to join the Shipping team.\n\nWe have an amazing group of engineers working to empower low-to-medium complexity merchants with a delightful out-of-the-box solution, designed to streamline end-to-end shipping needs. In 2022 we helped self shipper ship over 115M orders and buyers track over 1.65B packages.\n\nYou\u2019ll be working with our Shipping Platform team to help launch our shipping platform, allow partners to sell shipping labels via Shopify Shipping and enhance our shipping services offerings to our merchants.\n\nQualifications\nMentor and coach Staff or Lead level developers to ensure their growth and development.\nBuild trust and drive the technical direction of a complex domain by collaborating with engineering, product, UX, and other stakeholders.\nBe programming language agnostic! We are looking for someone that knows which tools to solve which problems.\nEstablish or improve technical patterns that positively impact the Engineering craft at our company.\nProvide thought leadership and guidance to the Shopify engineering community, helping them to get shit done more effectively.\nSimplify Shopify systems within a large domain, streamlining processes and improving overall efficiency.\nHave a multi-team scope, impacting not only your own team but also neighboring teams and influencing patterns and direction for an Engineering subdiscipline.\nDefine new patterns that are adopted by the entire subdiscipline, setting the standard for technical excellence.\nRepresent Shopify's technical direction in the industry, showcasing our innovative approaches and solutions."
