Les soumissions en fran\u00e7ais sont les bienvenues.\n\nThis is the job for you if you are fast on your feet, an independent and self-motivated learner, and extremely excited about building things from scratch \u2013 but building them to last and grow! We want to hear from you if you love making products that make sense \u2013 that means you\u2019re not shy to ask lots of questions, and definitely not scared to say \u201cwait a minute, do we really need to write code for this?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll be working on a small team and you may be on your own sometimes, but it\u2019s important that you be an empathetic team player who likes to talk through problems with others and share your knowledge.\n\nWhen we say full-stack, we know it\u2019s a complicated term. It\u2019s okay if your experience is skewed towards one part of the stack! The key thing we are looking for is a good baseline level of familiarity with different parts of the stack and a willingness to move around and out of your comfort zone.\n\nAbout Rogo\n\nRogo is focused on building the world's first Natural Language Interface for data analysis. Robust natural language understanding and semantic parsing sits at the core of our efforts to create the future of analytic tooling. We're transforming academic and lab AI experiments into enterprise-ready products.\n\nThis is an opportunity to work on the full lifecycle of an AI solution and build a solid, scalable product that users love. Rogo is looking for engineers who can take problems into their own hands, and prototype, iterate, and ship quickly.\n\nYou'd be perfect for this role if you're a product engineer who loves data and cares deeply about making it accessible.\n\nSome Things You Might Do In This Role\n\nHelp build and architect a robust product and API for doing data exploration in plain English.\nDevelop analytic data products across econometric, statistic, and machine learning domains\nCreate beautiful and dynamic front-end visualizations for exploring data.\nContribute to the design and creation of a robust ensemble algorithm for translating normal English questions into executable commands (semantic parsing).\nCreate, deploy, and maintain ETL pipelines and ensure data quality.\nCreate experiences, digestible analytic outputs, and automated reasoning capabilities that will continually delight our users.\n\nAbout You\n\nWe want you to apply if you:\n\nHave 4+ years of experience writing and shipping code professionally;\nWrite clean, legible, and testable code;\nAre comfortable working across the stack, from frontend technologies like React all the way through to cloud providers;\nHave solid experience with at least one server-side web stack \u2013 Python experience is ideal, but we're flexible;\nKnow your way around database systems, whether SQL, NoSQL, and can talk about how to pick one over the other;\nAre able to articulate tradeoffs in technology choices and relate them to business needs;\nHave excellent communication skills and can explain complex technical problems in an accessible and compassionate way;\nCare a whole lot about building good user experiences;\nHave a proven track record of mentorship (if you\u2019re a more senior developer).\n\nSome Extra Stuff We Love\n\nExperience working on early-stage startups and ability to talk to us about growing pains resulting from early technical decisions.\nAn eye for user experience in data visualization\nA strong interest in DevOps methodologies, operational tooling, observability and automation. We are building foundations, and we want to make them solid.\nExperience building enterprise SaaS products, especially in the financial sector.\nExposure to products using machine learning\n\nWe are a remote-first company and Montreal region is preferred, but we are open to candidates anywhere in the EST time zone in Canada.
