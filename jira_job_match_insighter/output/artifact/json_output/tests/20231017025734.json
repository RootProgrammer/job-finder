  "job_description": "Who are we?\n\nWe\u2019re a team of engineers, thinkers, and champions whose aim is to give technology language. Every day our team is breaking new ground, as we build transformational AI technology and products for enterprise and developers that wish to harness the power of Large Language Models.\n\nWe're driven by ambition, as we firmly believe that our technology has the potential to revolutionise the way industries engage with natural language. Our strong technical foundation speaks for itself, with our team composed of world-class experts who have collectively accumulated hundreds of thousands of citations in academia.\n\nThe Cohere team is a collective of college dropouts, PhDs, alumni of big tech and scrappy start-ups, new grads and career pivots, who believe a diverse team is the key to a safer, more responsible technology. At Cohere, work isn\u2019t the opposite of play, as we build the future of language AI with team members on almost every continent in the world, working from high rises, cabins, tour buses, and dog-friendly offices.\n\nThere\u2019s no better time to herald the next step with us as we shape the future of Generative AI.\n\nWhy this role?\n\nAre you energized by building high-performance, scalable and reliable machine learning systems? Do you want to help define and build the next generation of AI platforms powering advanced NLP applications? We are looking for Senior Staff Software Engineers to join the Model Serving team at Cohere.

In this role, you will work closely with many teams to deploy optimized NLP models to production in low latency, high throughput, and high availability environments. You will also get the opportunity to interface with customers and create customized deployments to meet their specific needs.\n\nWe are looking for candidates with a range of experiences for multiple roles, from senior to staff-level engineers.\n\nPlease Note: We have offices in Toronto, Palo Alto, and London but embrace being remote-first!
