  "job_description": "Who are we?\n\nBased in Oxford and with offices in Canada and the US, Oxa is an international startup founded in 2014 and scaling up rapidly (300+ Oxbots and growing).\n\nAs the global leader in our industry, we\u2019re fuelled by a bold purpose: to make the Earth move better. From passenger shuttles to industrial vehicles, our operating system for Universal Autonomy\u2122 is transforming the way people and goods are transported by enabling any vehicle, in any environment, to operate autonomously \u2014 safely, securely and efficiently.\n\nOur technology is capturing investors\u2019 imagination. To date we\u2019ve raised $140 million in our Series C investment round. Accommodating growing demand from new and current shareholders, this funding is driving our expansion in North America and EMEA, and accelerating the deployment of our technology in domains where there is both urgent need and potential to scale.\n\nYour Team\n\nYou will join our Planning Team, where we design, implement, test and deploy the Engine that drives the behaviour of Oxa\u2019s Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), based on our understanding of our environment.\n\nYour Role\n\nAs a Senior Software Engineer in Decision Making, you will be responsible for designing, implementing, testing, and deploying algorithms that realise the desired behaviours that the AV needs to exhibit in any particular scenario. Specifically, this role will focus on Behaviour/ Manoeuvre Planning and Selection in the presence of other actors with uncertain future actions. You will work closely with Prediction and Trajectory Planning to scalably elicit predictable, explainable behaviours in the AV.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\nProvide technical leadership in the development, integration, and deployment of algorithms that enable AVs to navigate complex on-road environments. You will be a key contributor working closely with your Team Lead and shaping the development of the Oxa Driver\nDevelop the Engine that reasons over discrete actions and interactions with other actors, based on multi-hypothesis predictions\nCollaborate with the Routing team to incorporate longer-term and higher-level mission objectives\nCollaborate with the Trajectory Planning team to realise the actions and select the particular discrete action to be executed\nCreate appropriate metrics and tools to measure and benchmark the performance of planning algorithms deployed in various environments\nContribute significantly to the engineering lifecycle, including scoping, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance of your team's work\nDocument and train others on your team's work, focus on improving features, and understand the business and customer value of your team's work\nContribute to hiring and onboarding at scale by defining role responsibilities and requirements, leading interviews, engaging in recruiting outreach for your team, and mentoring and developing new team members\n\nRequirements\n\nWhat you need to succeed:\nPhD in related field (Mech Eng, Aerospace, Comp Science, Robotics, Mechatronics) with additional professional experience is desired\nMS in related field (Mech Eng, Aerospace, Comp Science, Robotics, Mechatronics) with extensive professional experience is acceptable\nPractical experience with Behaviour Planning, Decision Making and Trajectory Planning, preferably in Self Driving\nA deep understanding of Robotics Fundamentals, including:\nRobotics architectures\n2D/3D Geometry & transformations\nMechanics, kinematics, and dynamics\nProbability handling and uncertainty representation\nExposure to automated decision making (e.g., voting schemes, lexicographical ordering, etc)\nA proven track record of independent development and delivery\nModern C++ algorithm development and deployment in a production environment (including STL and common testing frameworks)\nUnderstanding of trajectory optimisation techniques\n\nExtra kudos:\n\nTechnical leadership and people leadership / management experience\nExperience with Machine Learning\nUnderstanding of POMDPs (algorithm/ formulation)\nExposure to Game Theory\nExperience with formal logic (e.g. temporal logic)\nExposure to safety certification standards and processes\nProven agility in fast-changing environments. As a scale-up, we\u2019re constantly evolving so our people need to evolve too for us to succeed together\nA customer-centric outlook. Chances are you won\u2019t be directly customer facing, but we value people who anticipate and prioritise the needs of our customers. We call it \u2018inventing on their behalf.\u2019\n\nThe Candidate Journey: Multi-Step and Two-Way\n\nNo-one wants to feel like a square peg in a round hole, so this process is designed to give you every chance to get the measure of us, and us of you. The various stages give you every opportunity to show your unique strengths and qualities, and enables each of us to establish if we\u2019re a good fit for the other. If the fit is good and you\u2019re selected, you\u2019re then in a position to do great work and thrive, which is what everyone wants.\n\nBenefits\n\nWe provide:\n\nCompetitive salary, benchmarked against the market and reviewed annually\nHybrid working arrangements\nLife Insurance\nAD&D Insurance\nLong Term Disability Insurance\nCritical Illness Cover\nExtended Health Care\nDental Cover\nHealth Spending Account\nPersonal Spending Account\nEmployee Assistance Program\n\nOur Culture\n\nWe believe that diversity of thought and experience is a key driver of innovation. It also makes life, and work, more interesting. So ours is a culture that celebrates humanity in all its diversity and richness, and uses difference as fuel to grow and succeed together. Everyone is welcome, everyone has a voice, everyone is valued. And our work and people are all the better for it.\n\nLearn more about our culture here.\n\nWhy become an Oxbot?\n\nOur team of experts in computer science, AI, robotics and machine learning is world-class, and together they\u2019re solving the most exciting and important technological challenges of our times.\n\nBut as well as smarts, Oxbots have heart. Our diverse, multi-cultural crew is guided by a shared vision to bring the myriad benefits of autonomy to our customers and partners. And in a company that celebrates uniqueness as much as skill and experience, they do it with energy, conviction and a healthy dose of excitement, too.\n\nIf you are bold, creative and hyper skilled, come and create the future of autonomy with us at Oxa."
